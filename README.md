# [LHCb](http://lhcb.web.cern.ch/lhcb/) Handbook

This is a collection of high-quality, curated software tutorials for LHCb.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for how to contribute to the lessons.

Please have a look at [CONDUCT.md](CONDUCT.md).

# The need for a handbook

There are already tutorials on various parts of the LHCb software linked in the
[LHCb TWiki](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/LHCb/LHCbSoftwareTutorials).
These represent an amazing effort by many collaboration members, who have
invested valuable time and effort into ensuring that other members of the
collaboration will be able to work effectively. Keeping this in mind, we want
to make sure that their efforts are not wasted.  Therefore, it is worthwile to
optimize the way we teach and learn at LHCb.

The first step is to identify problems which keep our current tutorials from
being more effective and useful. We have identified the following problems:

- Tutorials are difficult to find
   - The link above only contains a fraction of tutorials that are out there.
   - Googling for tutorials is made difficult by the fact that parts of the
     TWiki are password protected, and therefore not accessible to Google. To
     find tutorials in the TWiki, the TWiki search has to be used.

- Tutorials become outdated
   - The TWiki makes it difficult to keep track of which tutorials there are,
     which means it is difficult to notice or track down outdated tutorials.
   - The creation of tutorials is often a one-person affair instead of a
     group effort. It is difficult for a single person to keep a tutorial up to
     date over several years.

- Tutorials are often only available as slides
   - Critical explanations can be missing.
   - There is not enough room for larger code examples, which means they are
     often placed in an afs directory and potentially lost several years later.

- They are often created by a single person for a specific lesson
   - This means that there is no single style or "voice" that tutorials are
     written in, making them harder to follow.
   - They are often not followed up by improvements. Good tutorials need to be
     improved iteratively with feedback from other experts and learners.

The handbook is our attempt to mitigate these problems, by providing a single
repository of high-quality, curated tutorials.

By using the [fork-and-pull][gh-fork-pull] model, creators are required to engage
in a dialog with other members of the collaboration.
The handbook is a *group effort*, which means we actively encourage everyone,
meaning both creators and learners, to make their opinions heard.
The goal is to provide up-to-date, clear and useful instructions on how to get
things done using the LHCb software.

By developing tools for automatically testing tutorials and code examples, we want
to ensure that keeping the tutorials working and up to date is as easy as possible.

By using [gitbook](https://www.gitbook.com/) to render our tutorials as a simple
web page, we want to provide learners with a pleasant reading experience, while
making our lessons indexable for search engines.
